## Phase-1

- build static app with good UI

## Questions to answer

- how to put Text Element
- How to center content horizontally
- How to apply style to element
- How to update fontSize
- How to put background image to container
- How do you make background image full width and full screen
- what is resizeMode
- How do your prevent background image to hide your main content

- how to change App label
The way I did this for android (hacky, but it works) is just changed the string app_name field in

android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml

It will change the name of your installed android app to whatever you put as the value.
